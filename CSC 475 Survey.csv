On the cross walk, there is a couple walking their dog. The car does not recognize the couple on the cross walk and proceeds to hit them. Both individuals were seriously injured. 

Who should be held accountable for the injuries of those pedestrians? ","Scenario: A college student named is preparing for their senior art show. They use an AI image generator to create a series of digital portraits inspired by famous modern paintings. The AI model they use was trained on millions of online images, including copyrighted artworks, without the explicit permission of the artists or museums.
The student modifies the AI-generated portraits by adding their own personal, artistic touches. Their final pieces are displayed at the university gallery and shared online. The exhibition gains a lot of attention.
A week later, one of the original artists whose painting was used in the AI’s training data contacts the student, claiming that their piece is too similar to his work and violates his copyright. The student argues that their artwork is protected under ""fair use"" because they transformed the original image using AI and their own edits.
Is it ethical for the student to claim that the artwork is theirs and protected under ""fair use""?","Dr. Professor, a professor at a large university, teaches a graduate-level seminar on public policy. One of her students is known for being thoughtful but struggles with academic writing in English, their second language.
For the final project, students must write a 20-page research paper analyzing the impact of artificial intelligence on employment trends. The student uses a generative AI tool to help him organize his thoughts, summarize academic articles, and improve the clarity of their writing. They carefully check the AI’s work for accuracy and ensures that all cited sources are real and properly referenced.
When the student submits his paper, Dr. Professor is impressed by its clarity and coherence, much more than their previous work. She begins to suspect that they might have relied too heavily on AI. University policy allows “limited” AI assistance for brainstorming or proofreading but prohibits AI-generated writing from being submitted as original work. 
Should Dr. Professor accuse the student of academic dishonesty and report the student to the Academic Dean?"

Just because something might technically be legal doesn't make it right. The student should have been transparent about their process, acknowledged the original artist's influence, considered whether their edits truly transformed or merely exploited the original work, and ideally sought permission or at least credited the artists whose styles informed the AI's output.","It's not completely clear from the description if the student wrote the paper with assistance, or AI wrote the paper and the student just checked it thoroughly.  I wouldn't be happy in either circumstance, but would only report an academic integrity violation in the latter circumstance.  "

This training data can come from a variety of sources, and a majority comes from what's been said all over the internet, which can be heavily varied in accuracy. This makes me feel skeptical about how ""correct"" and accurate generative AI outputs can be, as they can be trained off of information that can be incorrect.","Yes. Their training data should only be able to come from an approved source of data that has been given permission to be used as training for AI. ","I feel neutral about this. Fair Use and Privacy Laws would be a good idea to protect many creators' works from being used in someone's prompt, but much of this could also be prevented if the companies developing training data for AI were also regulated.","AI is good at repetitive tasks, like generating testing code (to a certain extent) and identifying patterns in mass scientific data (under human review). However, AI is not good at generating new information and creative ideas. It should be focused on effectively doing mundane and repetitive tasks for large datasets and projects.","If the driver was able to take control, the driver should be held accountable since they should have paid attention to their surroundings since they should've been behind the wheel and taken control in an emergency situation. If the AI did not allow the driver to actually operate the vehicle, the company behind the software should be held accountable for this dangerous choice in design.","It is not ethical for the student to claim the art is theirs. Even though the work is modified, it is still built off the original creation, and fair use shouldn't apply. This is similar to uploading a song cover online. Fair use is generally not considered applicable as the creator of the cover should've attained permission from the copyright holder. This same principle applies to the artist here.","Yes. While the student made their own changes, the policy prohibited AI-generated writing from being submitted as original work, and AI partly wrote the paper. "

They need to be regulated to ensure that they are not unlawfully or unethically taking other people's data and work to train their AI.","","AI is generally helpful when it comes to attaining superficial information, editing/restructuring writing, writing and debugging certain code, and summarizing longer readings or excerpts. However, beyond this, AI often lacks accurate information about topics at a deeper level.","The makers of the car.","No, whether or not the student used AI to begin with, creating a piece of artwork too similar to another copyrighted piece (without the artist's permission) is not ethical and could be considered plagiarism.","No, it sounds like this student used AI ethically and carefully, not allowing it to do all of the work for them, but instead using it as a supplemental tool to aid in reading and writing in a second language."

People treating its output as factual (especially in cases without concrete answers) is incredibly dangerous.","Yes! I'm not sure HOW they should be regulated, but its no secret that everybody thinks AI can be a stand in for absolutely everything when that simply isn't the case. There are some instances where it's appropriate, but I'd imagine companies that get ahold of more powerful AI models will focus strictly on how they can capitalize off of its functionality.","Yes, though I'm not at all sure how. I'm very heavily biased against generative AI within the art space, because that should be one of the things left entirely untouched by AI. It's the labor that should be automated that AI needs to replace, and for those functions I have no issue with consumer use. But polluting creative spaces with AI output is something I very seriously wish was regulated/banned.","As of now, instantaneous web-searching is the only positive I can see to it, and even then, I don't know if I'd fully trust the results. It can definitely improve its accuracy when it comes to answering questions that don't have a single definitive answer.","The manufacturers of the car are at fault, neither the passengers of the car nor the pedestrians had a say in the accident.","No, as explicit permission to use the artworks in the pool of data for the AI to train on was not given. The AI had no ""artistic intent"" when mashing its data into a single image, so I'd even argue that there isn't much of a difference in the student painting over a copy of the original artist's piece itself.","Assuming ""organizing his thoughts"" and ""summarizing articles"" means ""organizing a list of notes to write from"" and not ""generating a paper that he didn't write himself"", I'd say this is fair use. AI does have proper uses that don't impede on the critical processes behind writing a meaningful paper, and I think that organizing thoughts and ideas into a more comprehensive list of notes isn't skipping anything important. However if this means that the student DID generate a paper straight up, then what's the point of having the assignment in the first place?"
