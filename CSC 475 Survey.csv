On the cross walk, there is a couple walking their dog. The car does not recognize the couple on the cross walk and proceeds to hit them. Both individuals were seriously injured. 

Who should be held accountable for the injuries of those pedestrians? ","Scenario: A college student named is preparing for their senior art show. They use an AI image generator to create a series of digital portraits inspired by famous modern paintings. The AI model they use was trained on millions of online images, including copyrighted artworks, without the explicit permission of the artists or museums.
The student modifies the AI-generated portraits by adding their own personal, artistic touches. Their final pieces are displayed at the university gallery and shared online. The exhibition gains a lot of attention.
A week later, one of the original artists whose painting was used in the AI’s training data contacts the student, claiming that their piece is too similar to his work and violates his copyright. The student argues that their artwork is protected under ""fair use"" because they transformed the original image using AI and their own edits.
Is it ethical for the student to claim that the artwork is theirs and protected under ""fair use""?","Dr. Professor, a professor at a large university, teaches a graduate-level seminar on public policy. One of her students is known for being thoughtful but struggles with academic writing in English, their second language.
For the final project, students must write a 20-page research paper analyzing the impact of artificial intelligence on employment trends. The student uses a generative AI tool to help him organize his thoughts, summarize academic articles, and improve the clarity of their writing. They carefully check the AI’s work for accuracy and ensures that all cited sources are real and properly referenced.
When the student submits his paper, Dr. Professor is impressed by its clarity and coherence, much more than their previous work. She begins to suspect that they might have relied too heavily on AI. University policy allows “limited” AI assistance for brainstorming or proofreading but prohibits AI-generated writing from being submitted as original work. 
Should Dr. Professor accuse the student of academic dishonesty and report the student to the Academic Dean?"
